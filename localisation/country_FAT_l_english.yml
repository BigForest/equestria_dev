 FAT_new_navy:0 "New Republican Navy"
 FAT_new_navy_desc:0 "Since the birth of our Republic, we didn't have even a single vessel under our command, now there has come the time to change it. With the establishment of a new navy, we have a great opportunity to rule the sea in northern Griffonia. Eventually, if everything will go well enough, we might even possess naval forces which could challenge that of the Trade Federation."
 FAT_battleship_focus:0 "Pure Superiority"
 FAT_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Erhart Grimclaw is a strong proposer of naval forces that can squish enemy in sheer size of ships, their amour, and most importantly, their guns. He had visited Equestria on more than one occasion, and when he returned, he was more than sure that our navy should be similar to that of Equestria, with great armored battleships leading it." 
 FAT_destroyer_focus:0 "Strength in Numbers"
 FAT_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Harald Helltalon, Is brother of Cornelius Helltalon, brother almost since their birth had a strong rivalry with eatch other, it has carried into their profession. Harald is a strong lobbyist of strength, not in agility, or size of our ships, instead in numbers, numbers that could let us throw a five smaller ships against enemy battleship or submarine. He also finds his brother idea to be at best, a fantasy."
 FAT_submarine_focus:0 "Hit And Run"
 FAT_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Cornelius Helltalon had on more than few occasions visited Changeling Lands in Equestria, and when he returned, he had nothing to tell us, but complements about their navy. With thing that amazed him the most, being a new class of a ship being a submarine. Such a ship could let us strike enemy hard when they least expect it, and then to run away from bigger ships, and then to strike again, even harder."
 FAT_navy_investment:0 "Additional Budget for Winghagen" 
 FAT_navy_investment_desc:0 "The City-port of Winghagen is one of biggest cities in the Republic, not to mention that its harbors and shipyards are among the biggest in all of northern Griffonia. Nonetheless, there are obvious problems, as most of the equipment used there is obsolete. If we would spare our funds, and nationalize all shipyards there, we could easily make Winghagen into the greatest port of northern Griffonia."
 FAT_navy_doctrine:0 "Focus Admiralty Under One Vision"
 FAT_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "As is Griffonian custom, our new admiralty likes to argue a lot. It is quite unproductive. But if we would put special attention on focusing our officers and admirals on working together instead of arguing, it would be very beneficial to us all."
 FAT_new_battleships:0 "Commission Battleships"
 FAT_new_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships shall be the unquestioned rulers of naval warfare, it is clear they will decide all naval battles that we will fight, and as such, we should strive towards getting some of them in our service. A good way to start would be using our new shipyards in Winghaven to create new battleships. There are talks about two promising projects we could develop there, the Dreadnought-class, and the Atreus-class."
 FAT_new_destroyers:0 "Buy Destroyers"
 FAT_new_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers form the backbone of every naval force in the world, and that won't change anytime soon. There are already many types of them in use, many of them more technologically advanced then whatever we could hope to create. As such, we should buy a few of them in not-so-great-condition, take them apart, learn everything we can from that, and then use that knowledge to base our own projects on."
 FAT_new_submarines:0 "Acquire Submarines"
 FAT_new_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are a new type of ship, they are being used only since a few years. Yet it seems like they might completely change naval warfare. As such, we need to get ourselves a few. If we would use some of our..."less legal"… connections, we maybe could get one or two of such submarines send to us in parts, and even if we won't manage to put them together, it will be a great lesion for our engineers."
 FAT_new_airforce:0 "New Republican Air Forces"
 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, we should do our best to join them in that. Having machines fly in the skies and attack enemies below, or keeping superiority in air is a relatively new concept, but it is one of these concepts that can truly change the way wars are fought, and we cannot let ourselves stay behind in such a department."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule The Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, so our pilots could take out enemy bombers and fighters, while staying safe themselves." 
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is killing as much of the enemy troops on the ground as it is possible without engaging them with our own ground forces. We should focus on creating planes that could carry as many bombs as it is possible, and that would let us strike the enemy positions no matter far how away they could be from our own troopers."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Experts Help"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing how we lack our own pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we would give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy, and maybe they would even lend their service as officers to us."
 FAT_new_bombers:0 "Acquire New Bomber Blueprints"
 FAT_new_bombers_desc:0 "Foreign Pilots that have come to us from other countries sometimes brought something additional other than knowledge with them. If we would splice everything together... we might be able to get working blueprints. and while yes, design of the frame is stolen from the Trade Federation, and their wings still bear Wingbardian markings, but these bombers will be the most modern in whole Griffonia."
 FAT_new_fighters:0 "Commission New Fighters"
 FAT_new_fighters_desc:0 "Thanks to new cadre of officers, our pilots are probably some of the best on the griffonian continent. But, our current fighters aren't the best designs around. If we would establish an initiative that would survey our pilots about their opinion on the upsides and downsides of our current fighters, we could somewhat correct current flaws, and hopefully let our pilots perform even better than they do now."
 FAT_grand_1:0 "Be Ready For Everything"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defense, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork. Where every action is planned, discussed and realized after everyone is sure that this is a proper course of action."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Fortify Our Positions"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders; we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialized units whose main task would be fortification of areas that our troops are currently occupying. Besides, using such educated troopers could be very useful, as they would would make it more likely for us to get intel from enemy radio frequences."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army has as of now mostly took care of our top commanders, and our units. But we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of excessive planning now."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Perfect Organization"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "Truly, our army now, as we finalize our reforms isn't in the same sorry state as before. Now it functions as a well oiled machine would. It goes to such a degree, that if we would want, we could even keep track of every single shot fired by out troopers at the enemies, and where it hit, and even when."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "Let's Drown Enemy in The Shells"
 FAT_superior_1_desc:0 "Why waste lives of our citizens, and ability to think independently of our commanders, if we could just throw hundreds, if not thousands of artillery shells at the enemy?"
 FAT_superior_2:0 "Bring Order Into Our Army"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most... disciplined bunch, and it goes to a such worrying degree, that using large amounts of artillery now could cause the risk striking some of our bolder troopers. As such, we should focus on introducing special detachments to our units, that will make sure that every of our soldiers will act like they should."
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artilery Units"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "Now that we are sure that artillery fire won't end in massive casualties on our side, we should give our divisions special small detachments of dedicated artillery guns and their crew, so our units can always crack even the most fortified enemy position." 
 FAT_superior_4:0 "Creeping Barrages"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "Now that we have enough artillery guns, there is a new tactic available for us. We could cover the assault of our soldiers with artillery fire, and drive the enemy out of their positions, or even just trap entire enemy units in a tight circle of artillery fire."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "Every Citizen Will Be a Soldier"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "We don't have to commission millions of shells, or to force our commanders to adhere to some idiotic protocols. Instead we can just do what always has been done, what has always worked, and now has the potential to be stronger than ever..."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join" 
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal militias roaming our country. If we would get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we maybe could get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of few new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty Program"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Now instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every Griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help with our manpower."
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death" 
 FAT_mass_4_desc:0 "We could extend our Amnesty Program to every prisoner in our country, POW, terrible criminal, or just a common thief, no matter. We will give them all the chance to redeem whatever crimes they have committed, if they will agree on fighting in our ranks."
 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Sensible Gun Laws"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarization in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded and uncared for stockpiles of them. If we would finally start gathering them back, they could be very useful for our army, even if first we would have to convert them all to same parameters."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Use Our Experience To Create Better Guns"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality_desc:0 "All that we had learned while converting, fixing, modifying, and changing all guns that we could get our talons all proved quite valuable. There are already many soldiers from our armed forces, who volunteer with their own projects for rifles, pistols, and SMG’s. It won’t be easy, but we now have a chance to arm our forces with best guns ever made in Griffonia."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity:0 "Scramble for Every Possible Gun"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity_desc:0 "Our recent experiments with modifactions of old guns have prooved to be quite fruitful, we even managed to convert some muskets into bolt-action rifles, *somehow*. This only proves that if we would set ourselves on that path, we probably could arm even every citizen. And now, with new gun-workshops set in place, we can make sure that even if we run out of the old guns, we can create new ones."
 FAT_arty:0 "Modernize Artillery Guns"
 FAT_arty_desc:0 "Now that our troops are properly equipped with rifles, we need to turn our attention towards bigger caliber artillery guns, if we would use the experience we had gathered while working on the carbines, it's quite possible we would be able to greatly improve our current design."
 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganize Support Units"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "While soldiers with guns are the main force in the army, units that provide them with medical care, take care of equipment, or make communication possible, are equally important. Yet they had been constantly overlooked in our doctrine, today, there has come a day to change that, and from now on, we will streamline their command chain, and make sure that the specialists are ready for their assignments."
 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Magi-tek Rifles" 
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of a gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy, but magic instead. Such guns might revolutionize the very nature of warfare. Besides, seeing how we even have many of the crystals used to power them, it would be ignorant not to use that. But most importantly, if we would enchant our current design, we could effortlessly create a better version of it."
 FAT_motorized_equip:0 "Mechanize our Army"
 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While using trucks has proven itself to be a good choice, they have also shown themselves to be very easy to damage and destroy by enemy fire, and if such trucks malfunctions, it can turn into a deathtrap for our soldiers. As such, we should now focus on slapping as much armor, and maybe even a gun on the trucks, and turn them into a moving fire positions, that can provide cover and supporting fire to our troopers."
 FAT_tanks:0 "Beats of Steel and Fire"
 FAT_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks have become one of the deciding machines on current battlefields, these great monsters made of steel can overcome truly amazing distances in a few days, can destroy most of fortifications with their guns, while being nearly impenetrable themselves. We should send our agents to nations that already use them, so we could get at least one or two, and reverse engineer them."

 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down griffonian using new methods of printing. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper. What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the educaton establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."

They alledge to have been attacked, and while authorities have officially disregarded the incident as just some teenagers experimenting with hallucinagens, sightings of the creature have increased. In fact, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. Any concrete evidence of the creature's existance however has not been found."

 griffonRepublic.62.t:0 "The Perfeatherain Affair"
 griffonRepublic.62.d:0 "Scandal shook the parliment today as it was heard that the secretary of defence, Jaxon Perfeatherain, was involved in an affair with a prostitute. If this wasn't embarassing enough, the prostitute in question, Cataleene Chickela was reportedly also sleeping with another griffon who just so happens to be a known spy for the Communist Revolution Front! Fears that state secrets may have been revealed to Ms Chickela and then passed on through pillowtalk have resulted in calls for the defence secretary to resign, pending further inquiry of ill conduct. Jaxon Perfeatherain denies any claims of ill conduct, but has tendered his resignation to the president. In his leaving speech from the senate, he regretted the loss of confidence in him and spoke of a desire to spend more time with family."
 griffonRepublic.62.a:0 "How embarassing!"
 
 griffonRepublic.63.t:0 "Only 500 Homes?"
 griffonRepublic.63.d:0 "This week has been marred with controversy as Secretary of Housing Tarold Wingwillian made a spectacular blunder in his address to the senate. Somehow his personal assistant had mistyped his speech and missed two entire zeros on the end of a number. Thus, instead of winning national support for our new housing project to build fifty thousand homes, the government has been belittled and ridiculed for pledging only to build five hundred homes. Worse, the Secretary of Housing did not notice the mistake and was thoroughly quizzed on it by the opposition."

 griffonRepublic.64.t:0 "The GRS Imperitive"
 griffonRepublic.64.d:0 "One of our newest destroyer models has yesterday gone missing after failing to report in while on maneuvers. After realising the destroyer was lost, our naval group was scrambled to search for the vessel. After a full twelve hours of fruitless searching, the destroyer appeared again, gliding out of thick fog. It was first thought the report was a fake as the position of the destroyer was well out of the area that it could have possibly traveled in that time, yet there it was. Even stranger, it was discovered afterwards that the destroyer was completely unmanned on arrival. The entire crew has been reported missing and the ship has been quarantined for further scientific and magical analysis."
 griffonRepublic.64.a:0 "It's a ghost ship you say?"
 
 griffonRepublic.65.t:0 "The Puritan Liberation Movement"
 griffonRepublic.65.d:0 "A counter culture has been gaining momentum today, opposed to radical changes in our very society. The Puritan Liberation Movement, as they style themselves, advocates that modern society is too lax about more adult subjects such as sex and relationships. Specifically, they are very concerned about the effect that profanity and violence could be having on the younger generations and advocate for some government controls and censorship of the media to protect those who are more sensitive. Their claims are being investigated by the media regulators, but intervention by central government is not planned as of yet."
 griffonRepublic.65.a:0 "Too much blood and guts for some"
