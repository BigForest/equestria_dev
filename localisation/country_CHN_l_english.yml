operationariettesphaseone:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase One"
operationariettesphaseone_desc:0 "Olenia holds great wealth for our nation, and their political crises has left it vulnerable to external influence.

operationariettesphasetwo:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase Two"
operationariettesphasetwo_desc:0 "With our infiltrators in place, we can now enact our plans proper. First, we must spread our ideology among the Olenian masses and gain as much support for an eventual civil uprising. It will take time, but the outcome will be worth it!"
operationariettesphasethree:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase Three"
operationariettesphasethree_desc:0 "Everything is nearly prepared. We’ve recruited a number of local leaders willing to rise up against the Olenian government in revolt. All we need to do now is to arm the rebels and watch the fireworks."

chncolonization:0 "Establish The Commissariats"
chncolonization_desc:0 "As legal as the new Olenian government is, the war has left the country in a state of disarray. In order to protect the interests of the common citizen, we must intervene directly. Hopefully, this will allow us to finally mingle with other races in the open. Perhaps this is the start of something greater..."
chncomshowtrials:0 "The Vaverfront Trials"
chncomshowtrials_desc:0 "Now that the war is won, the rightful Olenian leadership has approached us to oversee their trials of what remains of the old order. If we accept their request, it will bring our countries closer together politically and socially."
seize_production_desc:0 "The nation is in dire need of rapid industrialisation, and it stands to reason that the workforce itself knows best. By allowing the workers to control the centres of industry, we will see greater output and development from them."
equality_for_all_CHN_desc:0 "While some point to the likes of Stalliongrad and claim that there is no such thing as a truly equal society, it may yet ring true for Changelings. For untold centuries, we have shown a level of cooperation unparalleled by other races. If this great experiment can succeed anywhere, it is within our society."

CHN_Bomber_1:0 "Tactical Bombers"

CHN_Bomber_2:0 "Close Air Support"
CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than convential fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."

CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
